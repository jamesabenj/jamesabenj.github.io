While working through mod two and crafting my Sinatra portfolio project, it was amazing to find how easy ActiveRecord made working with models and databases. At the beggining of the mod, when working with raw SQL, it was tough to wrap my mind around complex joins and querry statements. The domain for my project was a subscription tracker that allows a user to track monthly spending, and ActiveRecord made working with those two models much more intuitive. 

One of the more difficult parts of the project came in styling. With limited time in CSS I found myself putting those googling skills to work.  Ultimately I was able to put together something pretty clean, albiet very simple, with some interactive tiles on the home screen.
